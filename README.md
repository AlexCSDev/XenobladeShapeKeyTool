# Xenoblade Shape Key Tool
This is a helper blender addon for [Turk645's Noesis Xenoblade Model Importer](https://github.com/Turk645/Xenoblade-Switch-Model-Importer-Noesis). This addon automatically loads morph names from wimdo file and sets proper shape key names.

Only tested to work with Xenoblade 3 models.

## Installation
Install like any other blender addon. The tool panel will appear in object mode.

## Usage
Select face mesh, go to the tool panel, select wimdo file for that model and press the button.
